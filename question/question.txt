In the kingdom of Choperderne, the prince is getting married! For the wedding, the king has invited 10,000 guests from all the ally kingdoms. 
As the prince is the king's only heir, the king decides to hold a grand celebration. In this celebration, he orders the local brewery to pack 10,000 bottles of the famous Choperderne beer for all the guests.
However, as it goes with large kingdoms, they stand where they are only after making several enemies. One of such enemies was the kingdom of Ioeptein, which wanted to end the dominance of the kingdom of Choperderne.
Thus, Ioeptein sent their secret warrior Gnastres to cause havoc in the prince's wedding. Gnastres planned to poison all the beer bottles which were to be served in the wedding.
However, Choperderne was well expecting its enemies to sabotage the wedding. So, all wedding related preparation was taking place under heavy guard. Determined to destroy Choperderne,
Gnastres bravely intruded the brewery and started poisoning the bottles. As soon as he poisoned one bottle, the guards spotted him, and he had to run for his life back to Ioeptein.
But now, Choperderne faces a huge task ahead of determining which bottle has been poisoned. The poison took one whole day to kill a man after consumption, and the wedding was to happen the very next day. 
So, the king came up with an idea of forcing his prisoners to ingest little quantities of beer from every bottle to find out the poisoned bottle. You, a kind yet obedient minister, are given the task to find out the bottle till morning.
Find out the minimum number of prisoners that must be used to eliminate the threat. (One prisoner may ingest from more than one bottle)
